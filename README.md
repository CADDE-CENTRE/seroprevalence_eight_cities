# seroprevalence_eight_cities
Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) data from SIVEP-Gripe (files INFLUD20-14-02-2022.csv and INFLUD21-14-02-2022.csv) can be downloaded at https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/srag-2021-e-2022 and https://opendatasus.saude.gov.br/dataset/srag-2020.
See Data Dictionary.pdf for the data dictionary.

Four datasets needed to reproduce the analyses must be downloaded from Dryad: https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.dz08kps08. These are the dataset used to estimate seroprevalence; the dataset containing convalescent plasma donors used to estimate sensitivity; the dataset containing tested samples collected before the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Brazil; the dataset containing repeat blood donors used to estimate the seroreversion probability curve. 

It is worth noting that the exact date of sample collection, which is used in the main analysis, was substituted by the week of sample collection in the Dryad dataset to ensure anonymity of blood donors.
